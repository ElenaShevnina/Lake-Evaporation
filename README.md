### 3.1.1 The eddy covariance
20180101_20180207_EC_FLUX.txt; XXX_EC_FLUX.txt: the post-processed data on the fluxes collected during austral summer 2017/2018 in the Schirmacher oasis, East Antarctica (Shevnina, 2019). This data set includes measurements collected by the integrated CO2 and H2O open-path gas analyzer and 3-D sonic anemometer (Irgason by Campbell Scientific. The Irgason is measured an absolute carbon dioxide and water vapor densities, three-dimensional wind speed, sonic air temperature, air temperature and barometric pressure (auxiliary sensor). The auxiliary sensors are Vaisala PTB110 as an optional enhanced barometer, and temperature sensor by Beta Therm 100K6A1A Thermistor. The post-processing procedure is described in Potes et al., (2017).
List of the variables in the dataset:
Date Time, is the time stamp (TS) with the format “yy/mm/dd HH:MM:SS”
npoints, is number of measurements
u_starr (m/s), taur Kg(m s^2) are u_star and momentum flux
Hcr (W/m^2) is a sensible heat flux humidity 
LE_wplr (W/m^2), is a latent heat flux 
Evap (L/m^2) is an evaporation by Potes M.
Fc_wplr (mg/(m^2 s)), Fc_wpl_umol (umol/(m^2 s)), is carbon flux with WPL correction, mg/(m^2 s) and umol/(m^2 s)
CO2_conc (mg/m^3), CO2_PPM (PPM), CO2_sig_str (arb), are CO2 concentration (two unit) and the Irgason’s signal strength 
H2O_conc (g/m^3), H2O_sig_str (arb), are H2O concentration and the Irgason’s signal strength 
Temp_amb (C), Amb_Press (kPa), are ambient air temperature and atmospheric pressure
wind_speed (m/s), wind dir_sonic (degree), are wind speed and direction
obukhov (m), zeta (arb), rou (m), sigmaw_ustar (arb), are Obuhkov length, stability parameter, roughness
Xmax (m), XR90 (m), are 90% of footprint (m) and maximum of footprint (m)
